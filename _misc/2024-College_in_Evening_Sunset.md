## "Do not say it is late in life, for the sunset still paints the sky beautifully." 

Over the thirteen days from the call for submissions to the deadline, I racked my brains trying to extract something unique and brilliant from my daily scientific research life. 

However, the unchanging scenery of the academy, day after day and year after year, seemed to leave behind only a sense of fatigue and indifference. 

Yet, on the evening of the deadline, the splendid sunset adorned the sky, and this fleeting beauty soothed the long wait, as if everything had been meant to be.
