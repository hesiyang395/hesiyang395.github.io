I get my Master degree in Biological & Pharmaceutical Engineering, and will work at HIOM in Hangzhou. 

I am now working on microbiology research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [hesiyang395@outlook.com](mailto:hesiyang395@outlook.com).

I graduated from [School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学生命科学技术学院) with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, advised by Prof. [Hongzhi Tang (唐鸿志)](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/HongzhiTang). I also collaborate with A.P. Weiwei Wang (王伟伟) closely.

During my academic career, I won the National Scholarship and Excellent Graduate of Shanghai (1% of student awarded) in Master, and my bachelor's thesis was selected as one of the Excellent Bachelor's Thesis (5 candidates annually for the College). 

My research interest includes multi-omics analysis, synthetic biology and microbiology. I have published a paper related to bio-synthesis as a solely first-author.
