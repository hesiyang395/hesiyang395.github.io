# üíª Research Experience

## School of Life Sciences & Biotechnology, SJTU

*Postgraduate*, *Sept 2021 to Mar 2024*

**Background:** The xenobiotics emitted by industry have cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic activities, requiring effective cleanup or removal strategies such as bio-remediation.

- **Led** a project focused on the method to convert complex aromatic contaminants into high-value compounds via biosynthesis
- **Responsible** for conceptualization, methodology and investigation that drove the project forward
- **Cultivated** strains with various substances and **appraised** the transformation capacity of strains and consortia
- This project led to the submission of **1 publication** (He et al., 2023, DOI: [10.1016/j.synbio.2023.08.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.synbio.2023.08.001)) and **1 patent**

## School of Life Sciences & Biotechnology, SJTU

*University Research Assistant*, *Jul 2020 to Aug 2021*

**Background:** i) Petroleum is a viscous, dark brown liquid consisting of a mixture of diÔ¨Äerent hydrocarbons, and it causes extensive soil pollution in the process of mining and reÔ¨Åning. ii) The inter-root soil microbial community and composition of wind and sandÔ¨Åxing plants would help to rationalize the planning of desert greening programs.

- **Conducted** 2 collaborative projects all focused on the method to treat environmental problems via biotechnology
- **Responsible** for designing experiments and contacting cooperators to drive the project forward toward patent prosecution
- **Collected**, **detected** and **analyzed** samples by the phylogenetic tree and microbial diversity analysis (QIIME 2)
- This project led to the submission of **1 patent** (CN113583908B)

## College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program 2018, SJTU

*Project Initiator*, *Mar 2018 to Mar 2019*

**Background:** DeÔ¨Åciencies in fatty acid biosynthesis have a wide range of eÔ¨Äects on plant growth and development, including premature cell death. During reproduction, fatty acids also have speciÔ¨Åc eÔ¨Äects on pollen and micro-spores, but the molecular mechanisms need to be further elucidated.

- **Collaborated** project focused on the programmed cell death (PCD) in Arabidopsis FAX1 mediated fatty acid mutants
- **Responsible** for experimental designation, manipulation to promote the project
- **Analyzed** the data of qRT-PCR to indicate diÔ¨Äerences between mutant and wild-type by Student‚Äôs t-test
- This project led to the submission of **1 publication** (Zhu et al., 2020, DOI: [10.1007/s11103-020-01036-5](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11103-020-01036-5))

## ClassiÔ¨Åer construction on the Kaggle breast cancer patient dataset Shanghai Jiao Tong University 

*Member*, *2022 Spring*

**Background:** Breast cancer is a disease that seriously endangers women‚Äôs health. Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment can reduce the possibility of its occurrence and the fatality rate. Therefore, improving the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer is an important means to reduce the life risk of patients.

- **Executed** a collaborative project that evaluated a numerical data set obtained by Ô¨Åne-needle aspiration of breast tumors to get an auxiliary diagnostic model providing relatively accurate reference results
- **Responsible** for data cleaning (tidyverse), predictor variables selecting and ranking (shrinkage & PCA) and classiÔ¨Åcation (e.g. logistic regression)
- Delivered 5 principle components for classiÔ¨Åcation, and 4 models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest and neural network) used in classiÔ¨Åcation all demonstrated an **accuracy of over 95%** with **area under curve of over 0.98**
