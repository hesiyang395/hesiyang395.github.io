## Publications

- [**He, S.**, Wang, W., Wang, W., Hu, H., Xu, P., & Tang, H. (2023). Microbial production of *cis,cis*-muconic acid from aromatic compounds in engineered *Pseudomonas*. *Synthetic and Systems Biotechnology*, 8(3), 536–545.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.synbio.2023.08.001)
    > This paper is about developing a “biological funneling” strategy based on genetic modification to convert complex aromatic compounds into cis,cis-muconate (ccMA) using *Pseudomonas putida* B6-2 and *P. brassicacearum* MPDS as biocatalysts. It provides worthwhile insights into efficient production of ccMA from aromatic hydrocarbons by reusing complex pollutants.

## Honors & Rewards

- [China National Scholarship 2023](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/7817), Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China
    > *The highest level of national scholarships established by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Every year, more than 2,000 colleges and universities and nearly 27 million students compete for 60,000 national scholarships, with only 0.2% of them being awarded.*
